Weather App based on OpenWeather


This weather application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with the ability to search for weather information based on their location input. The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display real-time data including the current temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. Special thanks to Reza Mehdikhanlou for their valuable contributions during development.
